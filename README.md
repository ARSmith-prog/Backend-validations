# README -- Code The Dream Backend 2 Week 2d

This repository contains the framework for a Rails application called customer-order. Unfortunately the Treehouse videos do not cover some critical
skills required of Rails developers.  Therefore we have developed additional material and presentation slides to cover these key subjects.

Your assignment, to complete by the end of week 2, is here: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1rcn2UVcTbDBNuu8s6FTsWDKpTZUy9lzsknjDX8QXYdk/edit?usp=sharing

Once you have completed this assignment, push your work to github and issue a pull request for the validations branch you created in the assignment.
